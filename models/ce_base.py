"""Trompa Base model

While the schema.org types and properties are mainly to provide semantic
structure to the data in the CE, the metadata properties are there to provide
for global searches on the basis of search terms. For this reason, all metadata
properties accept scalar type values only.
Any node in the CE represents a web resource. A nodeâ€™s metadata properties
contain information about either the web resource itself, or about a thing
(real or abstract) or the file that this web resource is about.
